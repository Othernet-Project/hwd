This package provides APIs for obtaining information about hardware. Currently
it supports storage and network devices. Main use case is hardware management
in Librarian_, so it falls fairly short of being useful as a general hardware
mangement tool. It is also Linux-specific and has not been (and will not be)
tested on any other platform.

See ``examples`` directory for some usage examples.
