hwd
===

hwd wraps around `pyudev <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyudev>`_'s ``Device``
objects to provide functionality specific to different types of hardware.
Currently, hwd provides a base wrapper class that provides common information
such as bus, vendor, and model, and classes for wrapping storage and network
devices.

hwd is being developed at `Outernet <https://outernet.is/>`_ specifically for
integration of hardware management functionality into `Librarian
<https://github.com/Outernet-Project/librarian/>`_ that runs on Outernet
receives. As such, there are no plans for adding support for devices that are
common on personal computers.

Installing
----------

hwd is in early development, and is therefore not yet published on a PyPI
repository. To install the latest development version from GitHub, use this
command::

    pip install https://github.com/Outernet-Project/hwd/archive/develop.zip

Basic usage
-----------

To use the wrapper classes, you need ``pyudev.Device`` objects. You can obtain
them using pyudev API, or using the :py:func:`~hwd.udev.device_by_subclass`
helper function.

Once you have one or more ``Device`` objects, you can instantiate the wrapper
classes, passing the ``Device`` object to the constructor.
